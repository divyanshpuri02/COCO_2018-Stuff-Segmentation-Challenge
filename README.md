# COCO_2018-Stuff-Segmentation-Challenge
COCO_2018-Stuff-Segmentation-Challenge  What is COCO?  COCO is large-scale object detection, segmentation, and captioning dataset.  The COCO Stuff Segmentation Task is designed to push the state of the art in semantic segmentation of stuff classes. Whereas the object detection task addresses thing classes (person, car, elephant), this task focuses on stuff classes (grass, wall, sky). For full details of the stuff segmentation task please see the stuff evaluation page. Note: the newly introduced panoptic segmentation task addresses recognition of both things and stuff classes simultaneously. This project implicates schematic segmentation, where raw RGB images are processed into the model and pixel masked images are given out as an output.
